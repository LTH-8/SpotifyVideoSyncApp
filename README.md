# SpotifyVideoSyncApp

A Windows desktop application that synchronizes YouTube music videos with your currently playing Spotify track. The app fetches track and artist information from Spotify, plays the corresponding music video from YouTube if one exists, and can display fun facts such as listening history stats or interesting details about the artist. Additionally, it provides the option to control Spotify playback from within the app.
